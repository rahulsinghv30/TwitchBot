# Twitch Bot
This project is using Python and Raspberry Pi in order to code a twitch bot which can directly read the chat and sends the messages onto the shell.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I added the twitch API for my twitch bot project and I made two modifications. One of them is if you type “!hello” which is a command in the twitch chat, the bot will respond back saying “Hello and the user’s name”. I used the API to call the functions ctx which puts the code into the twitch chat so the user can see it. The second modification I made was if the user types in “!randomNum” then the bot will spit out a random number between 1-10. I am also working on a third modification where every 15 minutes the bot will say “Remember to subscribe and like”.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to make a functioning Twitch bot. I first had to set up the Raspberry Pi for my project and download Python and the default version was 3.9.2.  I had to learn the features of the Pi. In order to make the twitch bot I had to look through two different guides and did some research to get a code that was functional. While doing this I was facing many problems with my code which I had to debug. I also had to update the Python version from 3.9.2 to 3.10.5 to make the code work. I later realized that my ouath ley was not working properly and decided to apply for a new one. And once I did that the bot started working.
