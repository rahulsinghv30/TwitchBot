# Twitch Bot
This project is using Python and Raspberry Pi in order to code a twitch bot which can directly read the chat and sends the messages onto the shell.

# Final Milestone
My name is Rahul and I go to Dublin High School in Dublin California, and I am going to be an upcoming senior this fall. The project I chose is the Twitch Bot, it is supposed to transfer the messages from the twitch website onto the shell of the bot and run commands which is part of my modifications for this project. I have some prior experience in python which is what this project is based on and I use twitch regularly so I know the features of the app and what I can do to make the bot more efficient. I have also made a GitHub page to show my code and milestone videos.

For my twitch bot I first set up the raspberry pi and synced it with my vnc code app so i did not have to use my monitor to use the raspberry pi. Then I created the code from scratch using a guide and I tried to debug the code and made my first milestone video. During the second week I used the twitch API to code their bots and then I could make modifications to those I made two modifications during that week and made my second milestone video. During the third week, I cleaned my code, worked on the github website, and made sure to debug some parts of the code that were not working. A quick rundown of my modifications, using the twitch io I made some commands such as; !hello the bot will spit out Hello, and the person’s name in the twitch chat. If someone types !randomNum, then the bot will spit out a random number between 1-10. I realized that it was not working. To make the code work I had to update the python version manually from 3.9.2 to 3.10.5. But then the code was still not working and I realized that I had to generate a new oauth key to make the bot sync with my twitch channel. I also added a routine function which is provided by api. This would display the bot controller a custom message. In my case I have programmed it to show the message of  like and subscribe after every 10 seconds. In future I can add more modifications to display this automated messages to the users after a fixed interval of time.

Some experiences I have gained from BSE are debugging skills, learning to use a raspberry pi, using apps such as vnc viewer, thonny, vs code, and learning about the twitch API. I joined BSE because I wanted to use a raspberry pi for the first time and learn more about python and API’s. I picked the twitch bot as my project because I use twitch a lot to watch my favorite gaming streamers, and I want to major in CS for college and I have previous python experience.

# Second Milestone
For my second milestone, I added the twitch API for my twitch bot project and I made two modifications. One of them is if you type “!hello” which is a command in the twitch chat, the bot will respond back saying “Hello and the user’s name”. I used the API to call the functions ctx which puts the code into the twitch chat so the user can see it. The second modification I made was if the user types in “!randomNum” then the bot will spit out a random number between 1-10. I am also working on a third modification where every 15 minutes the bot will say “Remember to subscribe and like”.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to make a functioning Twitch bot. I first had to set up the Raspberry Pi for my project and download Python and the default version was 3.9.2.  I had to learn the features of the Pi. In order to make the twitch bot I had to look through two different guides and did some research to get a code that was functional. While doing this I was facing many problems with my code which I had to debug. I also had to update the Python version from 3.9.2 to 3.10.5 to make the code work. I later realized that my ouath ley was not working properly and decided to apply for a new one. And once I did that the bot started working.
