# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# First Milestone
My first milestone was to make a functioning Twitch bot. I first had to set up the Raspberry Pi for my project and download Python and the default version was 3.9.2.  I had to learn the features of the Pi. In order to make the twitch bot I had to look through two different guides and did some research to get a code that was functional. While doing this I was facing many problems with my code which I had to debug. I also had to update the Python version from 3.9.2 to 3.10.5 to make the code work. I later realized that my ouath ley was not working properly and decided to apply for a new one. And once I did that the bot started working.
